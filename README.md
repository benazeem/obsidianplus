# Version One

## Issue One

This is the Version One of the Extension Project, But the main issue was I created this using the legacy Native Messaging API which does not give secure feeling to the users. So I decided to create Version Two of this Extension Project using Obsidian URI which gives more secure feeling to the users as it does not require Native Messaging Host to be installed on the user's system.

## Issue Two

The Second issue was that I created this extension project only for Obsidian and did not consider other Note Taking Apps like Drafts, Notion, Evernote etc. So in Version Two, I will try to make this extension project compatible with other Notes Apps.

## Issue Three

After the launch of this extension Obsidian launched their own extension which has better features than this extension. So I will try to add more features in Version Two to make it more useful for the users.

## Planned Improvements for Version Two

- Enhanced security with Obsidian URI protocol
- Multi-app support for popular note-taking platforms
- Improved user interface and experience
- Additional features based on user feedback
- Better error handling and logging

## Roadmap

- Q1: Core feature development
- Q2: Testing and optimization
- Q3: Beta release
- Q4: Official release with documentation
